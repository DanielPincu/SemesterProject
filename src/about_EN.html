                 MUSEUM OF MODERN ARTS, <br>
                  CRAFTS & DESIGN <br></h1>



        </div>

        <div class="col">
            <p>Trapholt presents a steady succession of exhibitions on art, design and crafts and also boasts its own collections, including a large collection of Danish furniture design.
                Inaugurated in 1988, the museum is located in a scenic area overlooking the Kolding Fjord. It is set within a large sculpture park featuring works by contemporary Danish artists.
                The museum’s architecture is an attraction in itself. Arranged around a central museum street, the exhibition rooms offer many fascinating spaces to explore. Outside, a powerfully sculptural wall separates the museum from the park</p>

            <h3>YOUR EXHIBITION</h3>
            <br>
            <p>YOUR exhibition allows you to create your very own exhibition. Go explore the museum and find pieces that have special meaning to you. Perhaps you want to focus on works that say something about family, nature, fun or something else entirely. It’s all done digitally – you get a round token to take with you around the exhibition, and this enables you to pick the works you want to include in your exhibition. Your exhibition will then be displayed on a big screen – and you can have it posted to the social media of your choice.
            Creating YOUR exhibition takes approx. ½–1 hour. Great fun for ages 5 and up – including the grown-ups!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>FUN ACTIVITIES</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Go explore the exhibitions in fun, creative ways. All assignment sheets are handed out by the guides. They will be happy to help you find an activity that suits your needs.</p>

We also invite you to explore the impressive sculptures placed all around the museum. Ask the guides for a ‘sculpture hunt’ sheet and see who can find the Mouth of the World, the White Rabbit and the Diamond Runner. <br>
            If you want to bring your own food and beverages, you can enjoy them at the tables and benches provided. You can also borrow a lawn game (‘Kubb’, AKA ‘Kongespil’) from the café.</p>
