        <p>Nanna Ditzel combined solid craftsmanship with artistic and cultural flair and
          inspiration. With this approach, she created unique and universal design icons. Looking at Ditzel’s design and
          sensing the connection between craftsmanship and inspiration, we understand how ‘the new thing’ does not arise out
          of mindlessly repeating the known, but comes when you are inspired, propelled by curiosity, to challenge the status
          quo while drawing on a rich, even startling variety of sources.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Celebrating the 100th anniversary of Nanna Ditzel’s birth, this exhibition called Nanna
          Ditzel – Taking Design to New Heights will be the most extensive show about her ever staged. It presents the story
          of how you can express yourself and evolve by being in touch with the inspiration that art, culture, nature and
          everyday life can offer.</p>

          MORTENSEN 
         <br> ROOM</h1>
       <p class="me-5">To create a space where architecture and painting merge: that is the main idea underpinning the Richard Mortensen Room at Trapholt.While the construction of Trapholt was underway, the museum’s director, Sven Jørn Andersen, was in talks with artist Richard Mortensen about acquiring a couple of paintings for the museum.</p>
          <button class="btn btn-primary mb-3" onclick="showOrHideDiv3()" id="myBtn3">Read more</button>

        </div>

      </div>

    <div id="showOrHide3">

      <p class=" mt-5 ms-5 mx-md-5">By this time, the abstract artist Richard Mortensen (1910–93) had long been keenly interested in the interplay between painting and architecture. Mortensen proposed that if the architects behind the museum, Boye Lundgaard and Bente Aude, would design a room dedicated to Richard Mortensen’s art, he himself would create a series of paintings especially for the museum.</p>
      <p class=" ms-5 mx-md-5">The project was duly realised: working in collaboration with the museum architects, Richard Mortensen created a polygonal space in which each work is given its own large, white wall. The Richard Mortensen Room was inaugurated as part of the official opening of Trapholt in 1988.The nine paintings featured in the room cover different periods and series within Richard Mortensen’s overall oeuvre.The sequence of the works is inspired by The Tale of the Cow, an ancient East Asian myth with which Mortensen first became acquainted as a young man. The story would have a major impact on Mortensen’s life and artistic work.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <p>The paintings follow the course of the simple narrative about a cowherd who has lost his cow, looks for it and finds it. The story may be regarded a folk tale with its simple plot reflecting a deeper significance. Briefly put, it concerns a man who reaches insight into the great questions of life and subsequently sets out into the world to speak about his experience – telling the Tale of the Cow. The story is cyclical, just like life itself.</p>
            <p>The works in the hall do not constitute a unified or continuous narrative. Rather, they reflect Mortensen’s perception and expression of various states of mind explored over the course of the narrative.
            </p>
            <p>The Richard Mortensen Room may be closed due to lectures and other events.</p>

      <p class="me-5">A major attraction for all those who are interested in design and architecture.
        Many are familiar with Arne Jacobsen’s world-famous chair designs: the 7 chair, the Ant, the Swan and the Egg. </p>

    <div id="showOrHide5">

      <p class=" mt-5 ms-5 mx-md-5">But only few know that the Danish architect and designer also created a modular summerhouse. Known as Kubeflex, the design revolves around cube-shaped modules that can be combined to suit individual needs, enabling the house to change its layout and size as required.Arne Jacobsen designed Kubeflex in 1969–70, just one year before his death in 1971, but it never entered production. Until 2002, the Jacobsen family used the house as a summerhouse. It arrived at Trapholt in 2005. The only one of its kind, the house is decorated with Arne Jacobsen designs inside.</p>
      <h3 class=" my-5 ms-5 mx-md-5">A summerhouse for the Jacobsen family</h3>
      <p class="ms-5 mx-md-5">For many years, the modular house was located on a south Zealand beach, serving as a summerhouse for the Jacobsen family. Only the most enthusiastic architects knew of its existence, but nevertheless many professionals contacted the family in the hope of being allowed to view this radical take on modern living.Now, it gives Trapholt and Arne Jacobsen’s family great pleasure to see the house made accessible to the general public, placed in the museum grounds and commanding splendid views of Kolding Fjord.</p>

      <p class="ms-5 mx-md-5">The Kubeflex house gives Trapholt a unique opportunity to show Arne Jacobsen’s designs in a house designed by the master himself. Visitors will find interiors set out as dining and living rooms, incorporating examples of Arne Jacobsen’s other designs, such as the Vola line of faucets and the Cylinda-line series. Audiences are treated to an immersive experience of the internationally renowned architect’s designs, which beautifully complements the museum’s large collection of furniture by Danish architects and designers.</p>
      <p class="ms-5 mx-md-5">Kubeflex was a pioneering contribution to the flexible architecture created back in the late 1960s. Preserved at Trapholt, Kubeflex will continue to inspire, amaze and delight guests from around the world for many years to come. Trapholt organises daily guided tours of the Kubeflex house; these tours are free for all museum visitors with a valid ticket.</p>
